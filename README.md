## Project Overview:
This project focuses on the implementation of three algorithms for frequent pattern mining in Python:

1. **Apriori Algorithm**: The classic approach for generating frequent itemsets.
2. **Improved Apriori Algorithm**: An optimized version introduced as our innovative contribution.
3. **FI-Tree Algorithm**: Implemented based on the methodology described in a selected research paper.

---

## Datasets:
The algorithms were tested on the following datasets to evaluate their performance:

- **Chess Data**
- **Connect Data**
- **Accidents Data**
- **Market Data**

---

## Experimental Results:
- The runtime and results for each algorithm are detailed within their respective Python scripts.
- These results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the algorithms, with a special focus on the improvements achieved in the Improved Apriori Algorithm.
